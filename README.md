# üöÄ Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict whether the **first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket** will successfully land after launch. 

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches at **$62 million**, significantly cheaper than other providers charging **$165+ million**. Much of the cost advantage comes from **reusing the first stage**. Accurately predicting successful landings can help external companies **evaluate SpaceX‚Äôs pricing model** or make informed bids against SpaceX for commercial launches.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

> Can we predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully based on pre-launch attributes such as payload mass, orbit, and launch site?

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash, BeautifulSoup  
- **Data Sources:** SpaceX Launch API, SpaceX website (scraped), public launch records

---

## üîÅ Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Retrieved launch data using a combination of **API calls** and **web scraping**
   - Compiled structured dataset containing payload mass, orbit type, launch site, booster version, and landing outcome

2. **Data Wrangling**
   - Cleaned and encoded features (categorical encoding, missing value imputation, data type casting)
   - Engineered features like orbit, booster version, and launch pad

3. **Modeling**
   - Trained classification models:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Decision Tree  
   - Evaluated using test accuracy and visualization

4. **Visualization**
   - Created an **interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly** to visualize:
     - Landing outcomes by launch site
     - Correlation between payload and success
     - Success/failure distribution across filters

## üìà Key Results

| Model                | Test Accuracy |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | **83.3%**     |
| SVM                 | **83.3%**     |
| KNN                 | **83.3%**     |
| Decision Tree       | **72.2%**     |

- Landing success is **positively correlated with lower payload mass** and **certain booster versions**
- Dashboard enables filtering by launch site and payload range
